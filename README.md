# Mage-platformer
My first 2D pixel platform game in Unity

I tried to make a simple platformer game using Unity and C#.

You can download my build for MacOS here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FIvXMrSYOIKy5oMWSgNZFkhSrkUla5P6/view?usp=sharing
Or you can make your own build for your platform

Controls:
a - left
d - right
space - jump
mouse left button - fire

Enjoy!
